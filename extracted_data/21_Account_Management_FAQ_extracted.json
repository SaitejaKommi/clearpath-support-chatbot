You can connect your Google or GitHub account for single sign-on. Go to Settings → Connected Accounts and click 'Connect' next to the service you want. Once connected, you can log in using that account. Note: You can still use your email/password even with social login enabled. Billing & Subscriptions How do I update my payment method? Go to Settings → Billing → Payment Method. Click 'Update Card' to add a new credit card or 'Switch to PayPal' to use PayPal instead.

Invoices include detailed breakdowns of charges, taxes, and any credits applied. Team & Workspace Management Can I transfer ownership of my workspace?
