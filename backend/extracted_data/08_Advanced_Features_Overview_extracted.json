Go to Settings → Workflows and add states like 'In Review', 'Blocked', or 'Deployed'. Define transition rules to enforce your process. Advanced Filtering Use filters to find exactly what you need. Combine multiple criteria: assignee, labels, due date, sprint. Save common filters for quick access. Syntax: 'assignee:me labels:bug sprint:current'. Timeline View (Coming Q2 2023) We're excited to announce Timeline view is coming in Q2 2023! This Gantt-style view will help you visualize project dependencies and deadlines. Stay tuned for the beta release. Bulk Actions Select multiple tasks to perform bulk operations: reassign, change labels, move to sprint, or update status. Shift-click to select a range or Cmd/Ctrl-click for individual selection. API Access Enterprise and Pro plans include API access. Generate an API key from Settings → API.
